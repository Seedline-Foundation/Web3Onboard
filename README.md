## Tool For Onboard: Go Web3 WordPress Plugin


 ### Introduction:

As the world of the internet prepares itself for the latest innovation in AI, Block chain, VR/AR, DAO, Metaverse, IOT and IOB technologies, businesses are not supposed to be left alone. They have to embrace these new technologies that'll help them function effectively in this ever changing world of technologies..

 
Block chain and cryptocurriencies are exploding and making  great impacts around the world. New ways of managing business are emerging. This Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an emerging technology that shifts the dominance of centralized capitalism from few benefiting individuals to community decentralized capitalism owned by a community of people. 

For example; big businesses like google.com, facebook.com, amazon.com are completely owned by a man and they exploit people and resources in achieving their purposes.That is a web2 concept.

Web3 concept seeks to get big businesses owned by a community of people. It is community driven. For example, **Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** is owned by over 80,000 people that voted on their constitution. They organized themselves as DAO and everything is transparent for everyone to see.

According to [Siteefy.com](https://siteefy.com/how-many-websites-are-there/), there are over 1.1billion websites today. Out this number, [cminds.com](https://www.cminds.com/blog/wordpress/wordpress-market-share-2021/#:~:text=WordPress%20Market%20Share%20Tops%2040%25&text=Its%20latest%20figures%20show%20that,when%20you%20narrow%20the%20data.) claims that WORDPRESS commands 43% of it and owns 63% market share. This is huge.

Of all wordpress websites, [w3tech.com](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress) claims woocommerce is the leading sector which commands 20% of all websites on Wordpress. If you don't know Woocommerce is the plugin that powers all wordpress business websites.

 In numbers, 43% of 1,139,467,659 is about 489.9Million websites. Which make business websites on wordpress amount to over 98.4million business websites.
